      <h1>Melissa Lycan</h1>
      <p>
        I have worked most of my life in the private sector in Sales and
        Management. After repeated success my passions took me into the music
        business. Over a decade in music and a Bachelor of Science in Music
        Business and I began to see trends everywhere. This sparked a passion
        inside me for BigDATA and I raced to attain a Masters in BI, where I
        discovered my love for math, strategy and logic all over again. Over the
        last 5 years I have taught HS Math in Denver. Currently I am honing my
        development skills and finishing certification in Full Stack Development
        so that I may build my own concepts and contribute to the greater
        accomplishments of mankind with my skills and talents.

        I believe in people and their incredible ability to be blissfully
        vulnerable and intensely strong all in the same moment. I believe
        creativity is the ultimate expression of this lifetime, whether it is
        coding, music, writing, painting or whatever you so choose. I am driven
        by unconditional love, a desire to constantly accept feedback that will
        improve my character and perspective, and a wanderlust for adventure and
        exploration that can only be atributed to a deep seeded ancestral
        calling.
